We have three method code in general:

- Simplethreshold represents the thresholding method for classifying.
- SVMtest is our SVM model
- CNN test is our CNN model. 

- ylabel_fah_sw20.xlsx is our data label

You can try change the file direct in front of every file to load different data. Ignore other .m files, they are just for testing new ideas.
