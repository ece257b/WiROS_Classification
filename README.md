# Data Collection and Classification of Wireless Sensing for Robotics Applications

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for implementing three different methods for classifying wireless sensing data: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Simple Threshold, and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). These scripts are part of a project aimed at analyzing Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Flight (ToF) profiles obtained from wireless communication devices.

## MATLAB Scripts
- `SVMtest.m`: MATLAB script implementing the SVM classification method. Runtime: 20 secs
- `Simplethreshold.m`: MATLAB script implementing the Simple Threshold classification method. Runtime: 10 secs
- `CNNtest.m`: MATLAB script implementing the CNN classification method. Runtime: 8 mins
- `label_loop.m`: MATLAB script to view profile images 1 at a time

Comments: You need to install the image processing toolbox and Machine Learning toolbox to run the code in MATLAB

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Run the desired script (`SVMtest.m`, `Simplethreshold.m`, or `CNNtest.m`) in MATLAB.
4. Test other data by changing the imports in matlab
